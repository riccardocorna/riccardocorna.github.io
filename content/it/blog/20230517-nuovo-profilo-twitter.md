If you like, I'm starting from scratch on Twitter with a brand new profile. There, I will mainly write in English.

Twitter profile picture

Why? Several reasons:

To get used to using English more often: I read a lot of content in this language every day, but I go through (too) long periods without writing or speaking it.
Because in the Microsoft realm on Twitter, there are really unmissable profiles and content, and above all, the MVP community there is very active.
Because, unlike LinkedIn, the type of content I offer doesn't resonate at all in Italian.
If you want, if you feel like it... here I am:

Of course, this will not in any way affect the activity I carry out on my blog, LinkedIn, or YouTube, which are my main channels and will continue their adventure! üòâ
