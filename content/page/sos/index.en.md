To provide you with remote assistance, you need to download a software called Splashtop SOS. This small program, only with your explicit consent, will allow me to connect to your PC and, together, we will see what is happening on your screen so that I can help you.

## How does it work?
The steps to get remote assistance are as follows:

1. **Click on the Download Splashtop SOS button**: you will be redirected to the Splashtop website and the download will start automatically

{{< rawhtml >}}
  <style>
    .button {
             background-color: #ff0000;
             border: none;
             color: white;
             padding: 15px 32px;
             text-align: center;
             text-decoration: none;
             display: inline-block;
             font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
  <p class="tc"><a class="button" href="https://sos.splashtop.com/it/sos-download" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Download Splashtop SOS</a></p>
{{< / rawhtml >}}

2. Once the software is downloaded, you will find it in the **Download** folder
3. **Run the software** by double-clicking the downloaded file
4. **Tell me the 9-digit number** you see on the screen
5. **Consent to the control of the PC**
