My name is **Riccardo Corna** and I am an IT Specialist. I work with **Microsoft** technologies, and on this blog, I share snippets of my lived IT experiences.

## Want to know more? Sure!
I work at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a **Cloud Solution Architect** in the **Modern Work Cloud Endpoint** field. I have over 15 years of experience with Microsoft technologies and, in my current role, I support clients in deriving the maximum value from **Microsoft 365**, **Intune**, and **Copilot**, removing any obstacles that might hinder optimal use. I perform my work with passion and my goal is to ensure that the ideal functioning of these tools becomes a decisive factor for the client's success.

[Waiting to be enrolled into the MVP Alumni program]: # "Thanks to the outreach activities conducted through this blog, I have been awarded as a **Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional)** in the **Security** category: here is my profile."

Outside of work, I don't mind delving into the world of **web** and **photography**, and I am truly fascinated by everything related to **communication** and **personal growth**.

I love Rock, Punk, and Indie music, silly T-Shirts, and potato chips in a bag. ðŸ¤¤

## My Skills
Over all these years, I have worked with various Microsoft technologies including Active Directory, Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Exchange, and Microsoft Security.

Today, specifically, I work with **Microsoft 365**, **Intune**, and **Copilot**.

However, deep down, a part of my heart is Apple-shaped, and I have gained good experience in integrating **Apple** technologies and devices in the corporate environment.

I always dedicate a part of my time to studying because I believe that continuous learning is an essential tool for developing one's skills and the necessary adaptability to today's technological and organizational changes.

Here are my verified Microsoft certifications:
