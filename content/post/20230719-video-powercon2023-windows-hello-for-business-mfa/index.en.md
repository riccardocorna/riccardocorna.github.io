A few days ago, the #POWERCON2023 was held, an online conference organized by the [ICTPower.it](https://ictpower.it) community. As always, I was very happy to participate, and this year, I chose to present a session on Windows Hello for Business, discussing an aspect that I believe is underestimated and not well-known to most: Windows Hello for Business is a passwordless and multi-factor authentication!

Do you want to know why and how it works? Just watch the video :)

Did you know that Windows Hello for Business is the MFA for Windows? Have you implemented it in your infrastructure? Let's discuss it together on my social profiles!
