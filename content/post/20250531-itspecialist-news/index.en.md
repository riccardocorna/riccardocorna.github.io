I’ve been thinking about this for a long time — I should have done it sooner — but I’ve finally made the decision: here is my first newsletter. It couldn’t be named anything else but ITSpecialist.news, borrowing the “ITSpecialist” label from this very blog, which has been part of my journey for nearly 10 years now.

## What will happen to this blog?
It will remain as an archive of all my content from 2013 to 2025. So much time has passed — I’m almost getting emotional. 🥲  
I’m keeping it alive so that all existing links to my content don’t break, and to preserve the historical memory of a tool that has been essential for me: the blog.

## What will you find in the newsletter? ✅
- **Practical guides** on Microsoft Intune, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft Security  
- **Technical deep dives** with real-world experiences and field feedback  
- **News and updates** from the Microsoft ecosystem  
- **Best practices** for adoption and configuration of tools

I don’t have a detailed editorial plan yet, but I promise not to flood your inbox. This is a new platform for me. I’ll learn, improve, and reflect on the right frequency — ideally, a couple of times a month to start, and weekly once I find the right pace and if it makes sense.

## Why a newsletter? 📫
This one’s long... read it only if you're really curious 😆

It’s been a varied journey that brought me here: I started (and still continue, because I love writing) with a simple blog, then moved on to LinkedIn (which has been incredibly rewarding), dabbled in video content... and eventually felt the need to connect the dots.

The idea is to reclaim ownership of the content I produce and distribute it to people who genuinely want to connect with me — people who choose to subscribe to a newsletter, not just be one of 10,000 followers of which I can only reach 8%-10%, and maybe 20% when I write posts that pander to some social media algorithm.

Yep, social media.

It’s just not working for me anymore. I’d rather have 1,000 genuinely interested readers than 10,000 who I never really reach. I’d rather spend time creating better content than cracking my head trying to write what an algorithm wants, the way it wants it.

I believe Substack offers everything I need to connect those dots: I can write, publish videos, and podcasts — and everything goes straight to your inbox. No middlemen, no algorithms. You read me because you want to, and when I publish something, nothing and no one can decide whether or not you’ll see it — except you.

Does that mean I'm "retiring" from social media?  
No, but the way I’ll show up there will change. LinkedIn, from now on, will only be used to inform the community that “something new” is out — and it’ll be hosted in a dedicated space, one that you consciously choose to follow and visit.
