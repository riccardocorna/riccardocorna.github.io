My personal holiday calendar says that after Halloween but before Christmas, there‚Äôs at least one more: WPC! üòÄ  
WPC (November 26-27-28), the most important annual event in the Italian ICT landscape, is just around the corner!

This year, I‚Äôll be there again as a speaker, with a session that has a bit of a "crossover" flavor: Microsoft Intune and Apple macOS.
Microsoft and Apple‚Äîa dualism that used to stir passions but, in my view, no longer has any reason to exist in terms of "opposition."  
In fact... Intune (SPOILER: and now also Entra) ‚ù§Ô∏è macOS, and we'll see it together in my session!
