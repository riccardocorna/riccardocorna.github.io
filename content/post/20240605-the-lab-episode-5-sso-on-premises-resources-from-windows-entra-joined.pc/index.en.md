Today we see the first concrete result of building our hybrid lab inspired by a modern management of identities and devices: we will test together if a Windows Entra Joined PC can access an on-premises resource in single sign-on, specifically a file server.

Will it work? Youâ€™ll see in the video :)

## SSO on On-Premises Resources with a Windows Entra Joined PC

### Introduction
IT specialists, hello everyone! We started the series The LAB some time ago: together, we have built a nearly complete hybrid lab environment.

An Active Directory domain controller, a Certification Authority, we have seen how to implement LDAPS and, finally, how to synchronize on-premises Active Directory identities with Entra ID, to hybridize our infrastructure with the cloud.

Todayâ€™s video is **THE** one where we see the first concrete result of our work.

We will try to access a network folder on an on-premises file server, normally joined to the domain, from a Windows 11 Entra Joined PC.

The PC is joined directly to Microsoft Entra in the cloud, not to the on-premises domain.

Why am I so keen that it works and even more eager to show it to you?

1. Because field experience suggests that very few people are aware that this type of single sign-on is possible natively, out-of-the-box.
2. Because this, in my view, is a fundamental step in reducing dependence on on-premises Active Directory, at least for usersâ€™ Windows devices.
3. Because this was one of the declared goals of this lab: to manage clients in a cloud-native way without domain joining them.

Will it work? Letâ€™s see together, starting with the requirements and scenario description.

### Requirements
Letâ€™s start with the requirements:
- A Windows PC, in this case, Windows 11, Entra Joined, meaning directly joined to Entra ID: we have it.
- Hybridized Active Directory with Entra ID through Microsoft Entra Connect: done!
- The PC, to access the file server, must have network visibility with the domain controller and, clearly, with the file server itself.

***ATTENTION***: *do not confuse authentication with network reachability! We are now testing that a non-domain joined PC can access, by authenticating, a domain file server but, testing it this way, we are simulating a specific situation: the PC, while not domain-joined, is in the corporate network.*

Summarizing: today our user is in the office, okay?

What does this mean? That if we tried to do this same test from a network other than the corporate one, we certainly wouldnâ€™t be able to access the internal file server unless we had a VPN, or other solutions, or blah blah blah.

### Scenario Verification
That said, letâ€™s do all the necessary checks: no tricks, no cheating!

#### Verify the Windows PC Hostname
Letâ€™s start by seeing what our test PC is called

#### Verify Non-Domain Join
Perfect, now letâ€™s verify that it is NOT joined to the on-premises domain itspecialist.local, our Active Directory for The LAB.

{{< youtubestartend vmAxRlVrh1o 193 205 >}}

Okay, we didnâ€™t find it.

#### Verify Entra Join
Letâ€™s look it up on Microsoft Entra.

{{< youtubestartend vmAxRlVrh1o 209 222 >}}

Found it! It is our Entra Joined PC.

#### Verify Status with dsregcmd
Still donâ€™t believe it? Letâ€™s do the acid test directly on the device by verifying its registration status with the dsregcmd command.

#### Verify Domain Controller Visibility
To make sure the scenario is clear, i.e., to show you that the user is in the office today, letâ€™s see if I can ping the domain controller...

#### Verify File Server Reachability
And if we can ping our file server.

### Let's Test Single Sign-On!
Okay! Weâ€™ve reached the moment of truth!

Now, finally, after months of building our lab, we finally see if our cloud-joined PC can access an on-premises file server without batting an eyelid...

{{< youtubestartend vmAxRlVrh1o 301 321 >}}

Yes, we did it. We took the first step to reduce dependence on Active Directory and, now, we can begin to soar towards true modern and cloud-native management of usersâ€™ devices.

### Supported SSO Scenarios on On-Prem Resources
So, ultimately, what can an Entra Joined device do SSO for when it comes to on-premises resources?

At the moment, two scenarios are fully covered:
- Access to a UNC path on a domain member server, such as a file server.
- Access to a domain web server configured with Windows Integrated Authentication.

There are some limitations which you can explore in detail through the usual ton of documentation below:

ðŸ”— [What is a Microsoft Entra Joined device?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-directory-join)  
ðŸ”— [How SSO to on-premises resources works on Microsoft Entra joined devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/device-sso-to-on-premises-resources)

### Conclusions
As always, I tried to show you the highlights of everything needed to achieve this result: to get there in your production environment requires a thorough analysis, especially at the application level!

Application authentication, especially if it relies on on-premises Active Directory, is the most important issue to clear up in any evolutionary project involving authentication, whether user or device.

That said, whatâ€™s next for The LAB?

We will continue to configure our environment: strong authentications, Conditional Access, Password Protection, device enrollment in Intune, onboarding devices to Defender for Endpoint, in short, we will continue to expand our lab like a Sim City, or... we could set ourselves an even more ambitious goal!
