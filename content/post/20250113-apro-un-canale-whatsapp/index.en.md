💻 IT Specialists! Hello everyone!

💬 I want to do a small test by opening a WhatsApp channel: I'm trying to create a more direct space, outside of various algorithms and social media.

❓ Why a channel and not a community? Because I believe each of us already has too many groups on WhatsApp, most of which are probably even muted. 😅
I don't want to add more clutter to your WhatsApp chats. 😃

📰 Few updates, only the important ones, so you won't miss any content as soon as it comes out: that's the idea.

As I mentioned earlier: it's just a test for now, let's see how it goes, if you like it, and what shape it takes.

To see and read the full content, as always, just go to the blog and YouTube.

If you're interested, here below is the link to the channel.
Thank you!
