üö® New episode of Copilot for Pod... oops... no... sorry, I meant Defender for Podcast! ü§£ With all these Copilots, I'm getting a bit carried away!

{{< youtube sLgzNqgUKU8 >}}

Caught up in a frenzy of memes and various quotes (absolute gems not to be missed), Marco Moioli (henceforth known as Mar-Copilot) and I couldn't miss the opportunity to talk about the current star: Copilot for Security!
We'll explore what it is, how it integrates with various Microsoft products, and, most importantly, share our impressions on the significant value this product brings.
