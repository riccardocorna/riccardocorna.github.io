Hi everyone! 🌟

During the summer of 2024 and even now, as most of us have settled back into our usual routines, I haven't posted much: some people have started asking me, "Where are you? Is everything okay? You haven't posted anything lately!” 😃

Here's an update! Actually, nothing particular has happened.  
Firstly, my new work experience is absorbing me, which is normal, especially in these early stages.  
Moreover, in this new position, I am now focusing on Modern Work and no longer vertically on Security!

What does this mean? This change in perspective is leading me to explore new viewpoints for the content I was already creating and, even more interestingly, brand new topics.

At this moment, I have decided to take a break to reorganize my ideas and find a more streamlined formula to manage everything: LinkedIn, blog, YouTube, Instagram (although the latter just for fun) are becoming too burdensome to maintain all at once, while keeping a good level of quality and engagement.  
I need to simplify, but I haven't figured out how yet. 😆

So, have you gotten rid of me? Absolutely NOT!

Defender for Podcast continues, with some new features this year! If you don't know what "Defender for Podcast" is, go to LinkedIn and search for "Microsoft Security Italian Users Group" and join: it's the largest Italian community on Microsoft Security, and we are now close to 3000 members!

And then? Community events: AperiTeams on October 9th and WPC on November 26th, 27th, and 28th: I'll be there!

And the tutorials, guides, and other technical content? Give me some time to work behind the scenes and refresh my editorial plan, if we can call it that.

OK? All clear?

See you soon and thanks for your continued support! 🙌

Your IT Specialist,  
Riccardo
