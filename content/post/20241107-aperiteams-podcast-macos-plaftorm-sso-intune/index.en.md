Despite the effects of the cocktail consumed on an empty stomach becoming increasingly apparent as the episode progressed, ðŸ¥´ I managed to stay on track and explain why Platform Single Sign-On on macOS with Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Intune is such a big deal. ðŸ˜€

Don't miss this episode of AperiTeams!

Thanks to Irene and Silvio for the super fun chat and the cocktail (by the way, DELICIOUS).
