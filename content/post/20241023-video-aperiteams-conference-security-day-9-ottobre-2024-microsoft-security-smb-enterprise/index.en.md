Last October 9, 2024, the [AperiTeams Conference Security Day 2024](https://www.aperiteams.it) took place at the Microsoft House in Milan and was streamed live. If you missed the live stream, no worries! All the event videos organized by [Inside Technologies](https://www.insidetechnologies.it) are now available online.

As always, it was a great day! I had so much fun with my "partner on the stage" [Simone Frigerio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frigerio-simone/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BWBr0SWVGThef1bxvK9OASw%3D%3D), and I hope it will be the first of many sessions together.

Here is the full video of our session, where we explained how some of the most advanced security tools within the Microsoft Security ecosystem are also available in the free tiers of Entra and for typical small and medium business scenarios, as well as for Enterprises.
