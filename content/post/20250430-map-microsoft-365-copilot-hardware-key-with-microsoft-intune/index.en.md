## Mapping the Physical Copilot Key

Today, we focus on mapping the physical Copilot key, present on newer PCs. This key allows you to launch the Microsoft 365 Copilot app with a single touch, further simplifying the user experience. To achieve this, we use a custom OMA-URI from Microsoft Intune.

Let's see how to create the policy and distribute this setting.

### Creating a Custom OMA-URI
Creating a custom OMA-URI is a simple and quick process: the specific details of the OMA-URI used are available below, right after the video snippet.

```
‚û°Ô∏è Name: SetCopilotHardwareKey
‚û°Ô∏è OMA-URI: ./User/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/WindowsAI/SetCopilotHardwareKey
‚û°Ô∏è Data type: String
‚û°Ô∏è Value: Microsoft.MicrosoftOfficeHub_8wekyb3d8bbwe!Microsoft.MicrosoftOfficeHub
```

### Verifying Policy Reception
Let's see what happens on the Windows client in the personalization panel.
