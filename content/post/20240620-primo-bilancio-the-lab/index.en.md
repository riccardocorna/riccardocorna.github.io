After reaching the first milestone of our lab, it's time to do a little recap. Below is the complete list of the first videos in the "The Lab" series, from creating the Active Directory forest to the first Windows Entra Joined client and its behavior in an on-premises environment.

Prefer reading instead of watching videos?  
No problem, here is [the complete collection on the blog](https://itspecialist.cloud/tags/the-lab/)!

How will our lab continue? Since the devices of our hypothetical end users are managed with Intune, in the second phase of The Lab I will focus on Intune, always with an eye on security.

On this note, since the lab was born from your idea, how about letting me know which topics or specific aspects you would like to see in the next episodes?

Let me know in the comments: your idea could be one of the next videos! See you soon!
