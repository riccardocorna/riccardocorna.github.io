IT Specialists! Here is a brief introduction to a new series: Cloud Endpoint Diary.

[Join me on YouTube, subscribe to my channel!](https://youtube.com/@itspecialistcloud)

{{< youtube ty0laLgK8oM >}}

This video series will explore everything about endpoint management with Microsoft Intune.

A couple of months ago, I shared a post on LinkedIn that gave birth to this idea.
In Cloud Endpoint Diary, we will address various aspects of endpoint management, from the simplest to the most complex configurations, creating a true IT life diary.

The goal is to keep the videos short and concise, with a lot of supporting documentation for your in-depth study.
I want to make the content faster and lighter, avoiding long introductions.

Do you like the idea? Let me know in the comments or on my social profiles.

Thank you for your support and for watching the video until the end.

Your IT Specialist,  
Riccardo
