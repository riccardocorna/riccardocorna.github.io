## Introduction to Windows Passwordless Experience
The Windows Passwordless Experience is a security policy that promotes the use of passwordless authentication methods, such as Windows Hello for Business and FIDO2 keys. This configuration is set up via Intune and activates for the last user who logged in on the workstation.

Let's see the standard situation on a machine where Windows Hello for Business is configured but without Passwordless Experience.

## Configuring the security policy via Intune
Configuring the Windows Passwordless Experience via Intune is very simple. Just activate a switch in the Intune settings. This promotes the use of passwordless authentication methods on the login screen and in other specific situations where authentication is required.

Here's how to configure it.

## Effects of the configuration on the login screen and system settings
Once the policy is configured, the user's login screen will no longer show the option for password authentication. However, the password can still be used in specific situations, such as UAC (User Account Control) elevation or for help desk operator authentication.

Let's see what happened after configuring and applying the policy to our Windows client.

## How to continue using the password when necessary
Despite promoting passwordless authentication methods, it is still possible to use the password. For example, a help desk operator can authenticate on the workstation using the "Other User" option. This ensures that the configuration does not completely inhibit the use of the password but encourages the user to use more secure authentication methods.

Let's see how to use the password even with the Passwordless Experience configured.
