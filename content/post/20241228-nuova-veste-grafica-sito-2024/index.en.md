🚨 To use some "youthful" language: I just "dropped" the new look of my blog! 🤣

I chose a more practical and blogging-oriented theme compared to the previous one. Everything seems much more organized and pleasant to use. Multimedia content is much more prominent within the articles, and the post search has improved A LOT. Finally, there's also automatic management of potentially obsolete articles and a clearer and more evident dual language (ITA and ENG) management.
All this with a strictly static site, without databases, WordPress, and the like.

Not being a developer, I admit I had MANY difficulties in the release: different versions of Hugo with different behaviors, poor documentation, changes to the GitHub workflow, the evil .gitignore, page generation timeout, and various other issues.
Without going into details, I'll just say that with each failed build on GitHub Pages, my exclamations cost me the Christmas spirit for the next few years. 😓🤐

But... here we are! There are still some details missing on the categories, but I'll work on them more calmly in the coming days.

What do you think? Let me know in the comments!
