ðŸš¨ Important Update! Ending Support for Administrative Templates When Creating New Configuration Profiles. ðŸš¨

With the latest Intune release, it will no longer be possible to create new configuration profiles using Administrative Templates via

**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Windows 10 and later** > **Administrative Templates**

You will see a (*retired*) label next to Administrative Templates and the Create button will be disabled. Other templates will continue to be supported.

ðŸ’¡ New: You can now use the Settings Catalog to create new Administrative Templates configuration profiles by navigating to

**Devices** > **Configuration** > **Create** > **New policy** > **Windows 10 and later** > **Settings Catalog**

There are no changes in the following UI experiences:
- Editing an existing Administrative Template.
- Deleting an existing Administrative Template.
- Adding, modifying, or deleting settings in an existing Administrative Template.

For more details, as always, refer to the official documentation.
