**‚ö†Ô∏è üáÆüáπ To my Italian speaking followers!**

A few days ago, the winter edition of #POWERCON2023, an online conference organized by the [ICTPower.it](https://ictpower.it) community, took place.

It is certainly correct to say that Microsoft Intune is an MDM, and its main purpose is to manage devices. However, paraphrasing a famous song from the '80s, "beyond the endpoints, there is more"! Intune is, in fact, the pivotal tool through which to implement and deploy an infinite variety of security settings, in addition to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configurations. In this session, we will see, case by case, the tools and policies that Intune provides to standardize security policies on managed endpoints, bringing us closer to true Zero Trust Security.
