**‚ö†Ô∏è üáÆüáπ To my Italian speaking followers!**

WPC 2023 is also about coming together in person and quickly organizing new community activities! That's exactly what happened with Carlo Sacchi, the host of Azure Italia Podcast, whom I finally had the chance to meet in person.

After exchanging greetings, in less than 10 minutes, we had already organized a post-WPC 2023 chat, along with friends Pietro Visentin, Stefano Nieri, and Andrea Palumbo.

And on all the other major podcast platforms: Apple, Amazon, etc. üòâ

I believe we captured and conveyed the spirit of the event well: if you want to know more, all you have to do is listen and follow it, so you don't miss a single episode!

Thanks again to Carlo and all the other speakers who participated.

Happy listening!
