The video of the session ***Artificial Intelligence in the Service of Cybersecurity: From 0 to Microsoft Security Copilot*** that I held (together with Michele Sensalari) at Be Connected Day 11 on June 15, 2023, in Bologna, is now available online.

For convenience, I have embedded the video to start directly at the beginning of our presentation, but from the same link, you can actually watch the live stream of the entire day.

Enjoy watching!
