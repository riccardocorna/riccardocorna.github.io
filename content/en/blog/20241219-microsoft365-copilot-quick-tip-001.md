🚨 Microsoft 365 Copilot Quick Tip! In my current role, I work with many clients (I meet with up to 6-8 per week). Sometimes these appointments are just a few hours apart, and a couple of weeks go by before the next meeting. It’s not easy to manually remember and jot down everything left pending or an agenda for the next meeting in this battleship game that is my calendar. 🤣

✒️ Here's a super simple prompt I use in Outlook to refresh my memory as the next meeting with a client approaches.

> Analyze all my past conversations with the client *< X - full name and/or acronym >* and tell me:
> - What are the pending points with tasks on my end
> - What are the pending points with tasks on the client’s end
> - If an agenda of topics has been set for the next meeting I have with them

➡️ In the image, the result: no more memory gaps or time spent rewriting tons of notes about things already discussed. It’s all based on what was already covered via email or in meetings!

⚠️ Note: In this specific case, I asked Copilot to remove any references to the clients' names and the people involved from the output because I wanted to share the screenshot here. Of course, it might also be helpful to get reminders about the specific people involved in the activities!

👍🏻 Spoiler: I’m saving a lot of time.

❓ Do you use other prompts that help you refresh your memory when there are 1000 things to do and remember? Let me know which ones! Let’s discuss in the comments. See you soon! 😊
