Today, I pause for a moment of reflection.

Just a couple of months ago, I had resumed reading this book by [Vittorio Bertocci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vittoriobertocci/) because I felt the need to revisit some important concepts in the realm of authentication protocols.

After reading some passages from the book, I found myself exclaiming in my head multiple times, "Okay... now I get it! But couldn't the official documentation explain it this way?"

There is no better book than this one to grasp the fundamentals of this subject. Vittorio was the classic example of an author who, when writing, takes the responsibility to convey difficult concepts to the reader in the best possible way, explaining them simply and clearly and providing truly useful definitions for those who need to learn. When I delve into a challenging topic in my articles or videos, I have always thought that I would be happy to achieve even just 10% of how good he was at doing this, and that would be enough to provide great content.

Vittorio Bertocci has been and will continue to be a source of inspiration for anyone working in this field and creating content for the community.
