And on all the other major podcast platforms: Apple, Amazon, etc. üòâ

Beyond this episode, I recommend subscribing to the podcast so you don't miss any: it's rare to find content like this in the Italian language, and [Carlo Sacchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlo-sacchi/) is doing an excellent job!

Thanks again to Carlo for the invitation and the conversation: I was excited and had a lot of fun, maybe even too much, as we talked for over an hour without realizing it. ü§£

Happy listening!
