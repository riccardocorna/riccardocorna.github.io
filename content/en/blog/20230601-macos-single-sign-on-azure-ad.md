About 2 years ago (June 2021), I had fun experimenting with a new feature that was in preview: macOS Single Sign-On (SSO) for Azure AD on Microsoft 365 applications and services.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Update as of June 1, 2023** The "Microsoft Azure AD" plug-in is finally in General Availability and is ready to use in production environments!

You might be wondering, "What on earth is it for?"

**This feature allows you to authenticate yourself and your fantastic Mac more easily to Microsoft 365 services and applications without repeated credential prompts**, making the user experience even smoother and seamless.

**It is important to note that this extension does not allow device-level login on macOS. it is only for applications.**

Below, however, I'll provide you with some resources:

- The link to my video where I talked about and demonstrated the user experience

- A wonderful infographic by [Merill Fernando](https://twitter.com/merill), Product Manager at Microsoft (follow his profile, he's truly an endless source of useful information!).

If your Mac is managed by Intune, the configuration requires:
- Installing the Company Portal app on the Mac
- The operating system version to be macOS 10.15 or higher

Here's all the necessary information: üòâ

In a private conversation I had some time ago, I wrote the following: "...I believe there has never been a moment before when the products of the two worlds (Microsoft and Apple) have worked so well together..."

And I am increasingly convinced of this every day when I test features like macOS Single Sign-On. Microsoft is truly working closely with Apple, and the results are evident.

How about you? What measures have you taken to integrate macOS effectively within your company? I look forward to discussing.
