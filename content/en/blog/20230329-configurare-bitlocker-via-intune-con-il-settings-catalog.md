A few days ago, I came across a very interesting article from the Intune Customer Success Team. The article discusses how to configure BitLocker through the Intune Settings Catalog. This piqued my curiosity because, considering the Settings Catalog, there are now three different ways to deploy BitLocker from Intune.

I wanted to understand the advantages of using the Settings Catalog compared to the already available methods. Here's my experience!

‚ö†Ô∏è ***As mentioned in the video: the settings you see were done for purely educational and illustrative purposes. If you want to implement BitLocker in production in your environment, make sure to consider and analyze all the necessary factors, as the settings I used may not be suitable for your case.*** üòâ

If you want to delve deeper into the topic, here are some useful links, including the article that inspired this video:

How do you configure BitLocker via Intune? Do you use Templates, the Disk Encryption (Endpoint Security) section, or are you already using the Settings Catalog? Let's discuss it on my social profiles. I look forward to your input. Enjoy the video!
