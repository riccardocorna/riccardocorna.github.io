The video of the session that my friend Davide Salsi and I held at Be Connected Day 12 on May 30, 2024, is finally online.

In recent years, Microsoft Intune has been the main path towards a "Modern" device management. With the advent of AI and the release of new features, a new era in the device management paradigm is opening.â€‹
In this session, we will see in detail how these latest solutions can contribute to a cloud-native management of endpoints:â€‹
- **Cloud PKI**: Support for a cloud-based PKI, improving communication security and device authentication
- **Enterprise App Management**: Securely hosted enterprise app catalog, simplifying the distribution and updating of apps on cloud-connected devices
- **Device Query**: Advanced queries on endpoints managed by Intune, offering greater flexibility in device management.
- **Integration with Copilot for Security**: AI and advanced analytics to understand, predict, and improve end-user experiences.â€‹
