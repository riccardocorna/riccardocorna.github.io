This news was from the end of January, but amidst the chaos of activities and news, I can finally share it now: native management of macOS updates in Intune!

Prior to this functionality, managing updates for Macs enrolled in Intune was not very straightforward: scripts, third-party solutions, or user self-service management were required.

With this new set of features, it will be possible to natively manage the following types of updates from the Intune interface:
- Operating system updates
- Built-in apps (Safari, etc.)
- Firmware
- Malware Removal Tool
- XProtect
- Gatekeeper

In short, it's a significant step forward! I have some ideas lined up for videos on this topic, and I'll definitely create one as soon as I can!

In the meantime, if you want to dive deeper, I've prepared some fresh and flavorful documentation, hot off the press:
