In the session, I will talk about how Microsoft Defender XDR is a huge step towards a single control panel to oversee all aspects of security in our environment.

We will see what products and technologies it comprises and in what order it is suggested to deploy them, to have a complete view of the entire services stack.
We will understand how it is possible to enhance its capabilities by also having access, in a single panel, to the signals from Defender for Cloud.
With the upcoming availability of Copilot for Security, we will also discuss its integration with Defender XDR, with a brief overview of the possibilities it offers.
Finally, we will put together all the recommendations and signals provided by the listed services, in a concrete application of Vulnerability Management as a comprehensive hardening plan for identities and devices.

Who among you will be there? I look forward to seeing you!
