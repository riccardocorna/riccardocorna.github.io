I have tried the new Windows LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) with direct support for Entra ID.

{{< youtube oGbAqOxJOhQ >}}

If you have Windows 11 machines (which natively support it), it is really simple and fast to implement.

Here are some useful information:

ðŸ“Œ No licensing requirement, available from Entra ID Free and above

ðŸ“Œ Supported operating systems:
- Windows 11 22H2 - April 11, 2023 Update
- Windows 11 21H2 - April 11, 2023 Update
- Windows 10 20H2, 21H2, and 22H2 - April 11, 2023 Update
- Windows Server 2022 - April 11, 2023 Update
- Windows Server 2019 - April 11, 2023 Update

In the video, besides configuring the Intune profile to re-enable the built-in local Administrator, I also tested a slightly more specific scenario by renaming the Administrator. It is a good hardening practice that I have often encountered in the field, and it is very easy to configure via Intune Settings Catalog.

What can I say, you just have to watch the video for all the other details ðŸ˜‰

Are you already using LAPS in your infrastructure? Let's discuss it together on my social profiles!
