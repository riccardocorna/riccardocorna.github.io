🗓️ **#SaveTheDate July 14, 2023**: one last exciting event before going on vacation, the **#POWERCON2023**! A whole day with many sessions together with industry experts, talking about security, Microsoft Entra, Intune, Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, Defender for Endpoint, and much more. In short, I would probably run out of characters in a LinkedIn post if I wanted to list everything.
