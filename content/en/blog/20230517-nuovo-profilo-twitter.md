If you're interested, I'm starting from scratch on Twitter with a brand new profile. There, I'll be primarily writing in English.

[![Twitter profile image](/images/Web-capture_17-5-2023_111436_twitter.com.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/riccardocorna)

Why? Several reasons:
1. To get used to using English more frequently: I read a lot of content in this language every day, but I go through (too) long periods without writing or speaking it.
2. Because in the Microsoft sphere on Twitter, there are truly unmissable profiles and content, and the MVP community there is very active.
3. Because, unlike LinkedIn, the type of content I offer doesn't resonate at all in the Italian language on Twitter.

If you want, if you feel like it... here I am:

Of course, this won't affect my activity on the blog, LinkedIn, or YouTube in any way. They are my main channels and will continue their journey! üòâ
