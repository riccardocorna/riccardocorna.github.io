**⚠️ 🇮🇹 To my Italian speaking followers!**

In this first episode of Defender for Podcast, we try to focus on what the term "Microsoft Security" means: what it encompasses, which areas it involves?

{{< youtube wqKsPLyxAsI >}}

We will explore all of this from different perspectives:
- How to navigate in terms of licensing and which areas are covered by consumption and which by license.
- Within the licensed offering, at a high level, what is the ideal license/suite in relation to the type of company/reality: we will try to map this out.
- What are the various security areas and what are the corresponding administrative portals following their rationalization process.
