Friday resource! If you're tinkering with Local Groups Membership policies in Intune and (like me) have cursed a bit while converting group/role ObjectIDs to SIDs and vice versa, here's a website that does it online instantly and conveniently.

I'd love to tag the author of this wonderful utility (Erik Engberg) here, but from what I've seen, they're not on LinkedIn. If I'm mistaken and someone knows their exact profile, please let me know so I can give them proper thanks.

Final question: while finding the ObjectId for groups is very easy, where do you look for this value for Azure AD roles? Let's discuss on my social profiles!
