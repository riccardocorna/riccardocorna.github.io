On March 8, 2023, a joint event was held between the [Microsoft Intune Italian Users Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9007892/) and the [Microsoft Security Italian Users Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9051256/): the video of the sessions is now available.

Together with the legendary Michele Sensalari, we talked about certificate-based authentication on Azure AD.

Marco Moioli and Davide Salsi, on the other hand, delved into how to use the MAM (Mobile Application Management) features of Intune to provide security in BYOD scenarios, and Davide also demonstrated the new Microsoft Tunnel for Mobile.

In short, all good stuff for you IT specialists, but above all, for "secure people"! ðŸ˜‰
