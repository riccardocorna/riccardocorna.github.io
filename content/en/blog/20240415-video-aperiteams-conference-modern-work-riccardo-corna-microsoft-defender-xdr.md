If you missed the live stream, no worries! Starting today, all the videos from the [AperiTeams Conference (Modern Workplace Day) 2024](https://www.aperiteams.it), organized by [Inside Technologies](https://www.insidetechnologies.it), are available online. It was my first participation and I had a great time, as always during such days where training and networking come together.

Here's the complete video of my session, where I discussed how Microsoft Defender XDR represents a significant step forward towards a unified tool for managing the security of our infrastructure, whether it's in the cloud, hybrid, or multi-cloud.
