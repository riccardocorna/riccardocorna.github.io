Fresh news in the Microsoft Enter ID realm: templates and a brand new overview are now publicly available. Let's start with the templates.

## Template
Conditional Access policies are a powerful tool that offers a high degree of customization and granularity. That's why it can sometimes be less intuitive to know where to begin when it comes to implementing a particular policy for a specific situation.

The availability of templates helps in this regard by providing ready-to-use tools for specific situations, making it easier to implement a conditional access criterion.

Templates will be organized by scenario (currently, there are five) and will contain pre-configured settings based on the situation. Below is an example of a "Protect Administrator" scenario.

Of course, this is just a helpful starting point and cannot replace a thorough analysis of your own environment.

With that said, let's move on to the next update: a new overview page!

## New Overview
The new Conditional Access landing page leads to the fresh overview, which includes even more useful information:
- Information on sign-ins not protected by conditional access
- A clearer view to identify non-compliant devices
- The top 10 most accessed cloud apps without conditional access
- Plus, other enticing information :)
