My name is **Riccardo Corna**, and I am an IT Specialist. I mainly work with Microsoft technologies, but my heart is shaped like an Apple. On this blog, I share fragments of my lived IT life.

## Want to know more? Okay!
I work at [Microsys](https://msys.it), a Microsoft partner company, and I hold the position of **Senior Consultant** in the **Systems infrastructure and Security** area. With over 15 years of experience in Microsoft technologies, I design and implement cloud solutions based on **Microsoft 365** and **Azure** for clients, following a **Zero Trust Security** approach. I work with passion, and my goal is to ensure that optimal functioning of IT tools becomes a decisive factor for the success of the client and the company.

Thanks to the outreach activities carried out through this blog, I have been awarded the title of **Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional)** in the **Security** category. Here's my profile.

Outside of work, I don't mind delving into the world of **web** and **photography**, and I am truly fascinated by everything related to **communication** and **personal growth**.

I love Rock, Punk, and Indie music, silly T-Shirts, and potato chips in a bag. ðŸ¤¤

## My Skills
Over the years, I have primarily worked with **Microsoft** technologies. Specifically, I work with **Microsoft 365**, **Azure**, and **Active Directory**.

However, deep down, my heart is shaped like an **Apple**, and I have gained significant experience in integrating Apple technologies and devices in the corporate environment.

I always dedicate a part of my time to studying because I believe that continuous learning is an essential tool for developing one's skills and the necessary adaptability to today's technological and organizational changes.

Here are my verified Microsoft certifications:

Partly for the pleasure of helping those who may need some advice, and partly as personal notes that I occasionally refer to when needed.
